### Navbar
- [x] Fix highlighting for main navbar
- [x] Make logo go back to home also
- [ ] Add "socials" array of social objects with their logos
- [ ] Add socials as more options in dropdown nav
- [ ] Add socials dropdown to main page when size is large enough
- [ ] Add responsive
- [ ] Organize everything, condense

### Home
- [ ] Add main header
- [ ] Add secondary text
- [ ] Add gradient?
- [ ] Add main button to go to my projects
- [ ] Add secondary button that is similar dropdown to the socials

### Projects
- [ ] Use Notion as a CMS
  - [ ] Have a CMS for the actual technologies with an official name, array of nicknames, and small image of the logo
  - [ ] Have a second CMS for the projects, but with an array of the technologies that are linked to the other CMS
- [ ] Add heading
- [ ] Add search bar
- [ ] Add filters drop down
- [ ] Add project grid
- [ ] Add project card with title, description, see more that expands into individual page
- [ ] Add technologies drop down on each card

### Individual Project Page
- [ ] Add individual page based on slug
- [ ] Add image at the top with slight gradient fading into page
- [ ] Add technology badges under the image, truncate them if longer than the length of the page and have a dropdown where you can see all of them
- [ ] Add title, full description

### Cool feature, but is it useful?
- [ ] I think you can extra URL params on a route and get them in the base component of that page so you could theoretically have each badge of a technology be a link to filter the projects by a certain technology
