### Projects
- [ ] Create some sort of CMS with markdown and JSON
- [ ] Add loading state for the content, make artifial promise to test this
- [ ] Add error state for the content, make artificial error to test this
- [ ] Add heading
- [ ] Add search bar
- [ ] Add filters drop down
- [ ] Add project grid
- [ ] Add project card with title, description, see more that expands into individual page
- [ ] Add technologies drop down on each card

### Individual Project Page
- [ ] Add individual page based on slug
- [ ] Add image at the top with slight gradient fading into page
- [ ] Add technology badges under the image, truncate them if longer than the length of the page and have a dropdown where you can see all of them
- [ ] Add title, full description

### Cool feature, but is it useful?
- [ ] I think you can extra URL params on a route and get them in the base component of that page so you could theoretically have each badge of a technology be a link to filter the projects by a certain technology
